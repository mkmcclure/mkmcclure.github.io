            <p>
               WMUC Sports is the student-run radio station at the University of Maryland. The station broadcasts all major-sport home games as well as the road games in the immediate area and some beyond if needed. Broadcasters are placed on crews for different sports and broadcast them throughout the season.

            <h4>Hamilton Joes Baseball Team (2019-2020)</h4>
            <p>
               The Hamilton Joes are a baseball team located in Hamilton, Ohio. They are a member of the Great Lakes Summer Collegiate Baseball League and compete from June to August. I spent the summer broadcasting 39 games and working as the PA announcer for 3. I also wrote game recaps, recorded commericals, hosted a podcast and helped update the hardware the team used to make their broadcasts easier to manage. I was slated to return for the 2020 season, but it was cancelled due to COVID-19.

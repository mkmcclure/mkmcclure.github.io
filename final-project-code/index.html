                <p>COVID-19 kept almost everyone from doing and experiencing the things that they enjoy. Despite that, sports teams still managed to hit the field, ice and hardwood during 2020. Each of the four major sports leagues managed to complete their seasons and crown champions, but they lost significant money doing so.</p>

                <p>Franchise values are good indicators of a league’s overall health. The more successful a league is, the higher the value of the franchises that make it up. Forbes releases yearly franchise valuations for the four major American sports and they reported that NBA franchise values increased by only four percent, the smallest increase in a decade. The NHL saw their franchise values decrease on average, falling by about two percent on average.</p>

                <p>This is mainly because of the money lost due to all leagues, except the NFL, had to have games cancelled due to the pandemic. In addition to that, leagues lost almost all stadium revenue which is their largest source of income. Fan spending was down mainly because no fans were allowed in stadiums for an extended period of time. Teams lost all parking, ticket and concession money from that. All leagues rely on this income, but some do more than others. They also couldn’t capitalize on the increase in TV viewership because already had contracts with networks. All the leagues had these issues and responded to them in different ways.</p>

                    <h2>National Basketball Association</h2>
                    <p class="league-text">It’s estimated that NBA franchises depend on their arenas for about 40 percent of their income. The pandemic struck right in the middle of their season, so they had to shut down their operations essentially completely from March until July. Moving players into the “bubble” cost the NBA around $180 million. This was better than the alternative of not playing though, which would have been closer to $1.5 
                    billion. Overall, the NBA reported $8.8 billion in revenue in 2019 and that number was down to $7.9 billion in 2020.</p>

                    <h2>National Hockey League</h2>
                    <p class="league-text">Of the four major American sports, nobody relies more on their arenas than the NHL. The NHL relies about 80 percent on their arena for their total revenue. This is one of the main reasons that the league’s franchises saw their value go down last season. The virus also stopped the NHL season right in the middle. The NHL was forced to cancel the remainder of the regular season and jumped straight into expanded playoffs in their version of the “bubble,” which is expected to have cost between $75 million and $90 million. The NHL reported revenue of $5.1 billion in 2019 which dropped to $4.4 million in 2020. Their biggest loss in income came from ticket sales, with the projected loss being little over $1.3 million.</p>

                    <h2>Major League Baseball</h2>
                    <p class="league-text">No league was hit harder by the pandemic than the MLB. The league and the players association struggled to come up with a deal on what players would get paid for a shortened season and it all played out in the public view. They were eventually able to come up with a deal to play 60 regular season games, 100 short of a normal year. All the revenue from those games and the broadcasts of those games are lost and that’s the reason why MLB lost the most revenue of the four major sports. They brought in around $10.5 billion in revenue in 2019 and saw it plummet to $4.5 billion in 2020. The league relies on the ballpark for 39% of their income and that was lost over those 100 missed games.</p>

                    <h2>National Football League</h2>
                    <p class="league-text">The NFL had to most time to prepare out of the four major sports. The pandemic struck a little more than a month after the Super Bowl, so they had the luxury of watching the other sports and seeing what worked and what didn’t. The NFL brought in the largest revenue in 2019 with $14.5 billion, which tumbled to $9.5 billion in 2020. Again, the biggest loss for these teams was at the stadium, which they typically depend on for about 38% of their revenue. The NFL did fare better in this regard than the other leagues because some stadiums did allow fans to generate at least some revenue. The Dallas Cowboys, for example, averaged 30,000 fans per game and were estimated to have brought in around $621 thousand in stadium revenue which was the most in the league.</p>

               <p>Pro sports weren’t the only sports that were devastated by COVID. College sports were torn apart by the virus and many spring and some fall seasons had to be cancelled for the safety of the athletes. The repercussions of those missed seasons and revenue losses for schools are starting to come to the forefront.</p>

Many schools are still honoring scholarships but these schools believe they can no longer support these non-revenue generating sports. Some programs have started fundraisers to try and keep their programs alive but unfortunately, there aren’t always happy endings to these stories.</p>

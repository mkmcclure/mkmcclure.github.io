                <p>COVID-19 kept almost everyone from doing and experiencing the things that they enjoy. Despite that, sports teams still managed to hit the field, ice and hardwood during 2020. Each of the four major sports leagues managed to complete their seasons and crown champions, but they lost significant money doing so.</p>

                <p>Franchise values are good indicators of a league’s overall health. The more successful a league is, the higher the value of the franchises that make it up. Forbes releases yearly franchise valuations for the four major American sports and they reported that NBA franchise values increased by only four percent, the smallest increase in a decade. The NHL saw their franchise values decrease on average, falling by about two percent on average.</p>

                <p>This is mainly because of the money lost due to all leagues, except the NFL, had to have games cancelled due to the pandemic. In addition to that, leagues lost almost all stadium revenue which is their largest source of income. Fan spending was down mainly because no fans were allowed in stadiums for an extended period of time. Teams lost all parking, ticket and concession money from that. All leagues rely on this income, but some do more than others. They also couldn’t capitalize on the increase in TV viewership because already had contracts with networks. All the leagues had these issues and responded to them in different ways.</p>

                    <p class="league-text">It’s estimated that NBA franchises depend on their arenas for about 40 percent of their income. The pandemic struck right in the middle of their season, so they had to shut down their operations essentially completely from March until July. Moving players into the “bubble” cost the NBA around $180 million. This was better than the alternative of not playing though, which would have been closer to $1.5 
                    billion. Overall, the NBA reported $8.8 billion in revenue in 2019 and that number was down to $7.9 billion in 2020.</p>

               <p>Pro sports weren’t the only sports that were devastated by COVID. College sports were torn apart by the virus and many spring and some fall seasons had to be cancelled for the safety of the athletes. The repercussions of those missed seasons and revenue losses for schools are starting to come to the forefront.</p>

                <p>According to a site that has been tracking these announcements through February 21, 84 NCAA sports programs have been cut across the nation. Many schools are still honoring scholarships but these schools believe they can no longer support these non-revenue generating sports. Some programs have started fundraisers to try and keep their programs alive but unfortunately, there aren’t always happy endings to these stories.</p>
